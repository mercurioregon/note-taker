Note Taker App

This is an app that takes in and records notes entered by the user.  The user can also retireve and delete previous notes.

The app is scalable. Large fields capable of saving text blocks, images and files could be added and visible for the user to retirieve as needed. There could also be a connection to personal address books and calendars that could improve functionality.
